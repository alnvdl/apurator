A tool to easily compare bets and results for the Brazilian Mega-Sena lottery.

Written pretty much entirely using LLMs, with a bit of supervision for good 
practices and quality. Built and refined in 1 hour, without using dependencies, 
so it's not the most efficient or beautiful thing, but it works.
